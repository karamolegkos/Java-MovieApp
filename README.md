# Java-MovieAApp
This is Java Console Application to access an API with Movies. 

It works on all Java Versions!

Note 1: In the Java folder is the src/main/java in Eclipse. This folder contains all the packages of the Library.

# IMPORTANT

You need to use the MovieAPI dependency from my other [repo](https://github.com/karamolegkos/Java-MovieAPI).

# How to run

- Just run it as every Java Console Application
